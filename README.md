# Fake New York Times

#### Fake NY Times Home Page, 10/19/18

#### By Michael Meow

## Description

A clone of the New York Times home page built with Angular.

## Completed Features

This page has a component based layout that can easily exchange article content based on a JSON object full of articles.

API Key for NYTimes API has been obtained and experimented with, and is ready to be used next week.

## Features to be added

The features I would like to add next week are an API that grabs NYTimes articles and places them into the home page.  

I would also like an admin page which allows for easy choice for the type of articles displayed, and also allows the user to pick different layout options so the articles fit to the page.

A modal window will appear when the page loads, and the user will select the type of content they want to display.  Then they will select which types of layout to use based on the content that the API generates.

## Instructions

Please obtain an API-key from New York Times Article Search API and place in environment.ts file: 'apiKey: 'YOUR API KEY HERE','.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
